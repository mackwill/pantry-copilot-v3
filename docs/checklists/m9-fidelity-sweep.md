# M9 — Final full-board fidelity sweep

Run: `pnpm --filter @pantry/design-fidelity sweep` → open `tools/design-fidelity/output/report.html`.
Tripwire: `SWEEP_TRIPWIRE_PCT` (default 2%) on already-approved frames.

Approval = human review of reference│actual│diff (layout/spacing/type/color, not pixel-identity).
Mismatch %s below are pre-filled from the latest sweep; `not captured` means the
frame has no capture yet (web: `capture:web`; mobile: `capture:mobile`, see
`docs/launch-readiness.md`).

## Web frames (18)

All 18 captured (sweep 0/18 missing). %s below are the latest measured mismatch
(`pnpm --filter @pantry/design-fidelity capture:web:all && … sweep`), **not**
approvals — the approval column is the maintainer's after reviewing
reference│actual│diff in `output/report.html`. Residual %s are dominated by
known app-vs-board differences (mock recipe bodies, simpler side-nav, fresh
signup identity) — see the agent first-pass notes shared with the report.

## Mobile frames (37)

Capture: `pnpm --filter @pantry/design-fidelity capture:mobile` (booted iOS
simulator + running Expo app — see `docs/launch-readiness.md`). Each captured
screenshot is auto-resized to its reference width (`sips`) so the sweep diff is
meaningful (the ~60% mismatches above were a pure scale artifact, now fixed by
`normalizeForDiff`).

Tags: **`[deep-link]`** = a statically-addressable top-level screen;
**`[needs dev deep-link]`** = mid-flow / state-dependent view with no
addressable route.

**Capture method (important):** `simctl openurl pantrycopilot://…` does **not**
work against the installed dev build — iOS shows an unavoidable "Open in app?"
prompt and the expo-dev-client intercepts the scheme (grey screen). The working
method is **Maestro UI navigation** (`tools/design-fidelity/maestro/fidelity-capture.yaml`),
after `e2e/mobile/sign-in.yaml` establishes a session. **7 frames captured**
(✓ below); login was captured by deleting the server session
(`delete from sessions …`) and relaunching. 4 `[deep-link]` frames remain
blocked in this build (app-side fixes needed — noted inline). Each captured shot
is sips-resized to its reference width; `normalizeForDiff` handles residual
scale. % = latest measured.
