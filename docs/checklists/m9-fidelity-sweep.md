# M9 — Final full-board fidelity sweep

Run: `pnpm --filter @pantry/design-fidelity sweep` → open `tools/design-fidelity/output/report.html`.
Tripwire: `SWEEP_TRIPWIRE_PCT` (default 2%) on already-approved frames.

Approval = human review of reference│actual│diff (layout/spacing/type/color, not pixel-identity).
Mismatch %s below are pre-filled from the latest sweep; `not captured` means the
frame has no capture yet (web: `capture:web`; mobile: `capture:mobile`, see
`docs/launch-readiness.md`).

## Web frames (18)

All 18 captured (sweep 0/18 missing). %s are the latest measured mismatch
(`pnpm --filter @pantry/design-fidelity capture:web:all && … sweep`). Residual %s
are dominated by known app-vs-board differences (mock recipe bodies, simpler
side-nav, fresh signup identity).

**Sign-off (2026-06-26):** all 18 web frames **approved** by the maintainer.
The 17 cosmetic frames are intended-behavior accepts; `subscription-in-settings--web-…pro-active`
is accepted as the inline-on-`/settings` composition for v3 (the dedicated
Subscription page + usage meter is a post-launch enhancement). Rationale logged
in `docs/decisions.md` → 2026-06-26 fidelity-review entry. **Web fidelity is
complete.**

## Mobile frames (37)

Capture: `pnpm --filter @pantry/design-fidelity capture:mobile` (booted iOS
simulator + running Expo app — see `docs/launch-readiness.md`). Each captured
screenshot is auto-resized to its reference width (`sips`) so the sweep diff is
meaningful (the ~60% mismatches above were a pure scale artifact, now fixed by
`normalizeForDiff`).

Tags: **`[deep-link]`** = a statically-addressable top-level screen;
**`[needs dev deep-link]`** = mid-flow / state-dependent view with no
addressable route.

**Capture method (important):** `simctl openurl pantrycopilot://…` does **not**
work against the installed dev build — iOS shows an unavoidable "Open in app?"
prompt and the expo-dev-client intercepts the scheme (grey screen). The working
method is **Maestro UI navigation** (`tools/design-fidelity/maestro/fidelity-capture.yaml`),
after `e2e/mobile/sign-in.yaml` establishes a session. **7 frames captured**
(✓ below); login was captured by deleting the server session
(`delete from sessions …`) and relaunching. 4 `[deep-link]` frames remain
blocked in this build (app-side fixes needed — noted inline). Each captured shot
is sips-resized to its reference width; `normalizeForDiff` handles residual
scale. % = latest measured.

The "hit a snag (stream 0.0s)" failure had TWO Hermes causes, both fixed: (1) tRPC v11's `httpSubscriptionLink` resource disposal needs `Symbol.dispose`/`Symbol.asyncDispose`/`SuppressedError`, which Hermes lacks — polyfilled at a custom entry (`apps/mobile/index.js` → `src/lib/polyfills.ts`); (2) the real trigger, surfaced once (1) let the error through legibly: `newRequestId()` called the bare global `crypto.randomUUID()`, but Hermes has no `crypto` global, throwing `ReferenceError: Property 'crypto' doesn't exist` (wrapped as the empty `SuppressedError`). Fixed by a non-crypto UUID fallback in `@pantry/api-client` `request-id.ts`.
